### **3. Error Fallbacks Fixed**

- **After:** All error states reset to `free` with `3` daily exams

## 🧪 **Testing Scenarios**

### **Test 1: New User Registration**
1. **Clear browser data/incognito mode**
2. **Sign up as a new user**
3. **Expected behavior:**
   - User shows as "Free" plan
   - Daily exam limit shows "3" 
   - Student card shows "Daily Exams: 0/3"
   - After 3 exams: "Limit Reached" button appears

### **Test 2: Existing Free User**
1. **Sign in as existing user**
2. **Check user profile**
3. **Expected behavior:**
   - If user has actual free plan in DB: Shows 3 exam limit
   - If user was incorrectly premium: May show 999 until DB is fixed

### **Test 3: Daily Exam Enforcement**
1. **Take 1 exam** → Should show "Daily Exams: 1/3 (2 remaining)"
2. **Take 2nd exam** → Should show "Daily Exams: 2/3 (1 remaining)"
3. **Take 3rd exam** → Should show "Daily Exams: 3/3 (0 remaining)"
4. **Try 4th exam** → Should show "Daily limit reached! Try again tomorrow"
5. **Start Exam button** → Should be disabled and show "Limit Reached"

### **Test 4: Premium User (Paying)**
1. **User with active Stripe subscription**
2. **Expected behavior:**
   - Shows "Premium" plan
   - Daily exam limit shows "∞" or "Unlimited"
   - No exam restrictions

### **Test 5: Beta Tester**
1. **User with beta_tester = true**
2. **Expected behavior:**
   - Shows "Beta Tester" badge
   - Unlimited exams
   - No restrictions

## 🔍 **Quick Debug Checks**

### **Check User State in Browser Console:**
```javascript
// In browser console, check auth context values
console.log('Auth Context Values:')
console.log('Subscription Plan:', /* check auth context */)
console.log('Daily Exam Limit:', /* check auth context */)
console.log('Effective Access:', /* check auth context */)
```

### **Check Database Values:**
```sql
-- Check user subscription settings
SELECT 
  email,
  subscription_plan,
  daily_exam_limit,
  max_students,
  beta_tester
FROM users 
WHERE email = 'test@example.com';

-- Check daily exam count for a student
SELECT get_daily_exam_count('student-uuid-here');

-- Check if user can take exam
SELECT can_take_exam('student-uuid-here');
```

## 📊 **Expected Results After Fix**

### **Before Fix (Broken):**
- All users: `dailyExamLimit = 999`
- New users: Created as premium
- UI shows: "Daily Exams: 5/999 (994 remaining)"
- No exam restrictions for anyone

### **After Fix (Working):**
- Free users: `dailyExamLimit = 3`
- New users: Created as free
- UI shows: "Daily Exams: 3/3 (0 remaining)"
- Exam button disabled after 3 exams
- Error message: "Daily limit reached! Try again tomorrow"

## 🚨 **Red Flags to Watch For**

1. **User still shows 999 daily exams** → AuthContext defaults not applied
2. **New user created as premium** → Sign-up function not fixed
3. **After error, user gets unlimited exams** → Error fallbacks not fixed
4. **UI shows wrong limits** → Frontend still using cached values

## ✅ **Success Indicators**

1. **Free users limited to 3 exams/day** ✅
2. **UI shows correct limits (3 not 999)** ✅
3. **Exam button disables after limit** ✅
4. **Proper error messages appear** ✅
5. **Premium users still unlimited** ✅
6. **Beta testers still unlimited** ✅

## 🎯 **Next Steps After Testing**

1. **If tests pass:** Deploy the fix to production
2. **If DB migration needed:** Run `fix_existing_premium_users.sql`
3. **Monitor user behavior:** Check if upgrade conversions improve
4. **Update documentation:** Remove any references to the old premium defaults
