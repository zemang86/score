## **🧪 Technical Implementation Details**

### **Code Changes Made**:
1. **Import Statements**: Added `PremiumUpgradeModal` imports
2. **State Management**: Added `const [showUpgradeModal, setShowUpgradeModal] = useState(false)`
3. **Click Handlers**: Connected `onClick={() => setShowUpgradeModal(true)}`
4. **Modal Rendering**: Added `<PremiumUpgradeModal>` components with state bindings

### **Integration Points**:
- **Stripe Checkout**: All buttons route through same upgrade modal → Stripe integration
- **Environment Variables**: Requires proper `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` and Stripe configuration

---

## **⚠️ Known Dependencies**

1. **Stripe Configuration**: 
   - Environment variables must be set
   - Stripe price IDs must match `stripe-config.ts`
   - Supabase Edge Function for checkout must be deployed

2. **Database Schema**:
   - Users table with `subscription_plan` column
   - Proper subscription status handling

3. **Authentication**:
   - Free users default to `subscription_plan: 'free'`
   - Premium features properly gated by plan status

1. ✅ Open the Premium Upgrade Modal when clicked
