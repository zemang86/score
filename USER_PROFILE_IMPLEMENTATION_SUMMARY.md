# User Profile Feature Implementation Summary

## What Has Been Implemented

### 1. User Profile Modal Component
- Created `src/components/dashboard/UserProfileModal.tsx`
- Features:
  - Edit full name
  - Select Malaysian state from dropdown
  - Choose preferred language (English/Bahasa Malaysia)
  - Form validation and error handling
  - Beautiful UI with gradient styling and icons

### 2. Database Schema Updates
- Created migration file: `supabase/migrations/20250110000000_add_state_field.sql`
- Added `state` field to users table
- Added index for state queries

### 3. TypeScript Type Updates
- Updated `User` interface in `src/lib/supabase.ts` to include:
  - `language: string`
  - `state: string`
- Updated `AuthContext` to include default values when creating new users

### 4. Dashboard Integration
- Added profile modal to `OptimizedParentDashboard`
- Added "Edit Profile" button in welcome section (desktop)
- Added "Your Profile" section in sidebar (mobile)
- Integrated modal state management

## What Still Needs to be Done

### 1. Database Migration
The database migration needs to be applied to add the `state` field to the users table:
```sql
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS state text;
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_users_state ON users(state);
```

### 2. Verification Steps
1. Test the profile modal functionality
2. Verify data is being saved correctly
3. Test form validation
4. Test language/state selection

## Database Schema

The users table now includes:

email text
full_name text
subscription_plan text
max_students integer
daily_exam_limit integer
beta_tester boolean
language text DEFAULT 'en'
state text

## Usage
