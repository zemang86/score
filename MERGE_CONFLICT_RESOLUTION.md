# Merge Conflict Resolution

## Overview
Successfully resolved merge conflicts between our cursor branch (`cursor/improve-ui-ux-design-and-functionality-e181`) and the main branch on GitHub.

## Conflict Details
The conflict was in `src/components/admin/QuestionManagement.tsx` where both branches made improvements to the level filtering system:

### Our Cursor Branch Changes:
- ✅ **Predefined levels**: Fixed to show all 11 Malaysian education levels instead of only levels with existing questions
- ✅ **Complete education system**: Proper display of Darjah 1-6 and Tingkatan 1-5
- ✅ **Consistent architecture**: Used state management similar to subjects handling

### Main Branch Changes:
- ✅ **Case-insensitive matching**: Used `ilike` instead of `eq` for better level filtering
- ✅ **Level trimming**: Added `.trim()` to ensure consistent matching
- ✅ **Direct constant approach**: Used `allEducationLevels` constant instead of state

## Resolution Strategy
Combined the best of both approaches:

1. **Kept our predefined levels** - Ensures all 11 education levels are always visible
2. **Adopted main branch improvements**:
   - Case-insensitive level matching with `ilike`
   - Level value trimming for consistency
   - Direct constant array approach

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Level Filtering Query
```typescript
// Before: Case-sensitive exact matching
query = query.eq('level', selectedLevel)

// After: Case-insensitive pattern matching
query = query.ilike('level', selectedLevel)
```

### 2. Enhanced Level Filter Handler
```typescript
const handleLevelFilter = (level: string) => {
  // Trim the level value to ensure consistent matching
  setSelectedLevel(level.trim())
  setCurrentPage(1)
}
```

### 3. Restructured Level Management
```typescript
// Removed state-based approach
const [allLevels, setAllLevels] = useState<string[]>([])

// Adopted direct constant approach
const allEducationLevels = [
  'Darjah 1', 'Darjah 2', 'Darjah 3', 'Darjah 4', 'Darjah 5', 'Darjah 6',
  'Tingkatan 1', 'Tingkatan 2', 'Tingkatan 3', 'Tingkatan 4', 'Tingkatan 5'
]
```

## Benefits Achieved

### ✅ From Our Branch:
- Complete Malaysian education system visibility (11 levels)
- Consistent user experience showing all expected levels
- No dependency on database content for level display

### ✅ From Main Branch:
- Better search functionality with case-insensitive matching
- More robust level filtering with trimming
- Cleaner code architecture with direct constants

### ✅ Combined Result:
- **Enhanced reliability**: Level filtering works consistently regardless of data variations
- **Complete coverage**: All 11 education levels always available in filters
- **Better performance**: No unnecessary state management for static data
- **Improved UX**: Users see expected levels even if no questions exist for some levels

## Verification
- [x] Conflict resolved successfully
