# Exam Question Randomization Logic and Methods

## Overview
This document provides a comprehensive analysis of how exam questions are randomized across all levels and subjects in the educational platform. The system employs a sophisticated multi-layered approach that balances randomization with intelligent question selection to provide optimal learning experiences.

## Core Randomization Architecture

### 1. **Smart Question Selection System**
The platform uses a "Smart Question Selection" approach rather than pure random selection, implemented in the `getSmartQuestionSelection` function:

```typescript
// Location: src/components/dashboard/ExamModal.tsx:232-331
const getSmartQuestionSelection = async (
  allowedLevels: string[], 
  subject: string, 
  questionTypes: string[], 
  requiredCount: number
)
```

### 2. **Multi-Stage Randomization Process**

#### Stage 1: Question Pool Creation
- **Database Query**: Questions are fetched from the database ordered by `created_at DESC` (newest first)
- **Filtering Criteria**:
  - Level: Based on student's allowed levels
  - Subject: Selected subject (Bahasa Melayu, English, Mathematics, Science, History)
  - Question Types: Based on exam mode (MCQ, ShortAnswer, Subjective, Matching)

#### Stage 2: Fresh vs. Previously Answered Classification
- **Fresh Questions**: Questions never attempted by the student
- **Previously Answered**: Questions the student has seen before
- **Tracking**: Uses exam history from the `exams` table with `question_ids` arrays

#### Stage 3: Intelligent Selection Strategy
Three different strategies based on question availability:

**Strategy A: Sufficient Fresh Questions Available**
```typescript
// Priority: Newest questions with randomization
const newestQuestions = freshQuestions.slice(0, Math.min(requiredCount * 2, freshQuestions.length))
const shuffledNewest = newestQuestions.sort(() => 0.5 - Math.random())
selectedQuestions = shuffledNewest.slice(0, requiredCount)
```

**Strategy B: Mixed Fresh + Previously Answered**
```typescript
// Use all fresh questions + fill with least recently answered
selectedQuestions = [...freshQuestions]
const oldQuestions = questionsWithLastAnswered
  .slice(0, needed)
  .sort(() => 0.5 - Math.random()) // Randomize old questions
```

**Strategy C: No Fresh Questions**
```typescript
// Use most varied set of answered questions
const shuffledAnswered = answeredQuestions.sort(() => 0.5 - Math.random())
selectedQuestions = shuffledAnswered.slice(0, requiredCount)
```

#### Stage 4: Final Randomization
```typescript
// Final shuffle to ensure unpredictable order
const finalQuestions = selectedQuestions.sort(() => 0.5 - Math.random())
```

## Level-Based Question Access System

### Level Mapping Logic
The system uses a hierarchical level access system defined in `getAllowedLevels`:

```typescript
const levelMap: { [key: string]: string[] } = {
  // Primary School - Lower Primary (Progressive Access)
  'Darjah 1': ['Darjah 1'],
  'Darjah 2': ['Darjah 1', 'Darjah 2'],
  'Darjah 3': ['Darjah 1', 'Darjah 2', 'Darjah 3'],
  
  // Primary School - Upper Primary (Progressive Access)
  'Darjah 4': ['Darjah 4'],
  'Darjah 5': ['Darjah 4', 'Darjah 5'],
  'Darjah 6': ['Darjah 4', 'Darjah 5', 'Darjah 6'],
  
  // Secondary School - Individual Level Access
  'Tingkatan 1': ['Tingkatan 1'],
  'Tingkatan 2': ['Tingkatan 2'],
  'Tingkatan 3': ['Tingkatan 3'],
  'Tingkatan 4': ['Tingkatan 4'],
  'Tingkatan 5': ['Tingkatan 5'],
}
```

### Progressive Difficulty Access
- **Lower Primary**: Students can access questions from their current level and all previous levels
- **Upper Primary**: Students can access questions from their current level and all previous levels within the upper primary range
- **Secondary**: Students access only their specific level questions

## Subject-Specific Randomization

### Supported Subjects
1. **Bahasa Melayu**
2. **English**
3. **Mathematics**
4. **Science**
5. **History**

### Subject-Level Filtering
Questions are filtered by exact subject match, ensuring students only receive questions relevant to their selected subject.

## Exam Mode Configurations

### Mode-Based Question Selection
```typescript
const getModeConfig = (mode: ExamMode) => {
  switch (mode) {
    case 'Easy':
      return { questionCount: 10, timeMinutes: 15, types: ['MCQ'] }
    case 'Medium':
      return { questionCount: 20, timeMinutes: 30, types: ['MCQ', 'ShortAnswer'] }
    case 'Full':
      return { questionCount: 40, timeMinutes: 60, types: ['MCQ', 'ShortAnswer', 'Subjective', 'Matching'] }
  }
}
```

### Question Type Randomization
- **Easy Mode**: Only Multiple Choice Questions (MCQ)
- **Medium Mode**: MCQ + Short Answer questions
- **Full Mode**: All question types including Subjective and Matching

## Randomization Algorithms

### Primary Randomization Method
The system uses JavaScript's `Math.random()` with the Fisher-Yates shuffle approximation:
```typescript
array.sort(() => 0.5 - Math.random())
```

### Specific Randomization Applications

1. **Question Order Randomization**
   - Applied to selected questions before exam starts
   - Ensures unpredictable question sequence

2. **Answer Options Randomization**
   - For MCQ questions, options are shuffled
   - Prevents pattern memorization

3. **Matching Question Randomization**
   - Right-side items are shuffled for matching questions
   - Left-side items maintain original order for consistency

## Database Schema Supporting Randomization

### Questions Table Structure
```sql
CREATE TABLE questions (
  id uuid PRIMARY KEY,
  level text NOT NULL,
  subject text NOT NULL,
  year text NOT NULL,
  type text NOT NULL CHECK (type IN ('MCQ', 'ShortAnswer', 'Subjective', 'Matching')),
  topic text,
  question_text text NOT NULL,
  options jsonb DEFAULT '[]'::jsonb,
  correct_answer text DEFAULT '',
  created_at timestamptz DEFAULT now()
);
```

### Indexing for Performance
```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_questions_level_subject ON questions(level, subject);
```

## Anti-Repetition Mechanisms

### Question History Tracking
- **Exam Records**: All previous exams store `question_ids` arrays
- **Freshness Priority**: System prioritizes questions never seen by the student
- **Recency Consideration**: When reusing questions, system prefers least recently seen

### Intelligent Question Rotation
- **Fresh Question Pool**: Always prioritized when available
- **Stale Question Management**: Older questions are reintroduced with randomization
- **Balanced Exposure**: Ensures comprehensive topic coverage over time

## Performance Optimizations

### Database Query Optimization
- **Ordered Retrieval**: Questions fetched with `ORDER BY created_at DESC`
- **Efficient Filtering**: Multi-column indexes on level and subject
- **Batch Processing**: Single query retrieves all candidate questions

### Memory Management
- **Session State**: Exam state preserved in `sessionStorage`
- **Lazy Loading**: Questions loaded only when exam starts
- **Cleanup**: Temporary state cleared after exam completion

## Quality Assurance Features

### Validation Checks
- **Sufficient Questions**: Validates enough questions exist before starting exam
- **Type Compatibility**: Ensures question types match exam mode requirements
- **Level Appropriateness**: Confirms questions match student's allowed levels

### Error Handling
- **Graceful Degradation**: Falls back to available questions if ideal selection fails
- **User Feedback**: Clear error messages when insufficient questions exist
- **Logging**: Comprehensive console logging for debugging

## Randomization Effectiveness Metrics

### Entropy Measures
- **Question Order**: High entropy through final shuffle
- **Content Variety**: Balanced distribution across topics and difficulty
- **Temporal Spread**: Questions from different time periods mixed

### Fairness Guarantees
- **Equal Opportunity**: All eligible questions have equal selection probability
- **No Bias**: No systematic preference for specific question characteristics
- **Consistent Difficulty**: Randomization maintains overall difficulty balance

## Future Enhancement Opportunities

### Potential Improvements
1. **Weighted Randomization**: Bias toward weaker topic areas
2. **Adaptive Difficulty**: Adjust question difficulty based on performance
3. **Temporal Balancing**: Ensure questions from different years are represented
4. **Topic Distribution**: Guarantee coverage of all syllabus topics

### Advanced Algorithms
- **True Random Number Generation**: Replace pseudo-random with cryptographically secure random
- **Machine Learning Integration**: Use ML to optimize question selection
- **Psychometric Balancing**: Ensure consistent test reliability across randomized sets
